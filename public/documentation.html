    <h1>Welcome to my Movie Api Documentation Page</h1>

    <p> This Api is being designed to return a list of movies with individial data sets about each movie. <br>
        It's also being designed to return data about different genres and directors. <br>
        It should allow users to register with a username, password, email and birthday. <br>
        Allow each individual user to make lists of their favorite movies or watch later list and be able to remove movies from their list. <br>
        It should also allow users to delete their account or de-register, deleting their data from the database. <br>
